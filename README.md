- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m John
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in big data, building data pipelines and automation.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on a Flutter application with a Flask backend using Swagger OpenApi spec that lets users post surf conditions, and eventually photos, whereever they go. For now this designed to run on as a local server, but can be run on a k8s cluster as well, thanks to docker.
